## Using the Voice Assistant

The voice assistant will constantly listen for the wake word you have selected in Home Assistant. When it hears the wake word, it will display loading circles below your view.

While the loading circles are displayed, you can say a command. The command will then be displayed with the response from the Assistant and the response will be spoken out loud.
